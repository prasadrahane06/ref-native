### Steps to follow for adding dark mode when you make a new screen

Next, youâ€™ll add a new file to this repository.

1. Import this `const theme = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.global.theme);` or `const theme = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.global.theme) as ThemeType;`

2. You will get the light or dark theme by using the `theme` variable.

3. This is how you use it.

// Example of usage

    	<View style={[{backgroundColor: BACKGOUND_THEME[theme].backgound},
    					style,]} />

</View>
